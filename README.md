abstract="In this paper, we have proposed a novel model, called Bonferroni Mean Operator-aided Fusion of Neural Networks (BFuse-Net). Here, we have taken advantage of the capabilities of four deep learning models as the base learners and then applied a customized attention method to prioritize different fine-grained features by passing their outputs via four parallel pipelines. Next, we have employed a novel aggregation method, a modified Bonferroni Mean operator, to merge the decision scores acquired from every pipeline, prioritizing their individual contributions above their interactions with others in the decision scores. Three medical image datasets--- LC25000 (colon cancer), Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Malaria Cell Images have been used for experimentation. The model yields state-of-the-art outcomes for the three datasets. The source codes and additional results can be found at GitHub repository.",
